Do **not** rename or move the three subfolders — the script looks for them by exact name.

## How to Run

### Method 1

1. Extract "Apexs-AIO"
2. Right-click `Install-AllRuntimes-(RunAdmin!).ps1`
3. Choose **Run with PowerShell as administrato OR Run as administrator**
4. Let the installer run, it'll tell you when it's finished and will give you a .log you can check afterwards.

### Method 2 – When right-click → Run as admin is missing / doesn't work

1. Extract "Apexs-AIO"
2. Press Win + S → type PowerShell
3. Right-click Windows PowerShell → Run as administrator
4. In the blue window, type (adjust the path depending on where you saved the AIO):


& "ThePathYouDownloadedTheAIO\Apexs-AIO\Install-AllRuntimes-(RunAdmin!).ps1"


4. "Confirm everything installed correctly via Windows key + S > search; "Installed Apps" > (sort by date installed) > Confirm"
